# PolyCal - Polynomial Calculator

## Introduction

This is an command-line application for doing calculations with and plotting polynomials.

## A Note for Windows Users

This application uses ANSI escape codes, which is likely to be unsupported by the default cmd program of Windows. To enable ANSI support for cmd to use PolyCal properly, please install ANSICON [here](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/releases). After downloading ansicon, simply open cmd, go to x64 or x86 (depending on the specification of your machine) under where you downloaded ANSICON and enter ```ansicon.exe -i``` to install it.
