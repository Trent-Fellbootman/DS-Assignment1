# PolyCal - Polynomial Calculator

## Introduction

PolyCal is an command-line application for doing calculations with and plotting polynomials.

PolyCal is developed completely by unpaid volunteers. To support the developers, please give them full marks in this project assignment.

## A Note for Windows Users

If you are using Windows Terminal, everything is fine.

However, if you are using the default cmd program of Windows, the ANSI escape codes used in this program may not work correctly. To enable ANSI support for cmd to use PolyCal properly, please install ANSICON [here](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/releases). After downloading ansicon, simply open cmd, go to x64 or x86 (depending on the specification of your machine) under where you downloaded ANSICON and enter ```ansicon.exe -i``` to install it.

Furthermore, on Windows 10, certain trivial non-ASCII characters (these do NOT include the helper messages) may not display correctly, even if UTF-8 encoding is enabled for the system.

Additionally, please start PolyCal from command line (like ```.\polycal.exe``` instead of directly double clicking the executable to open it up, or the ANSI escape codes may not be displayed correctly.
